Project components:
   UArray2.h:      The UArray2 interface is an abstraction that implements
                   two-dimensional, polymorphic, unboxed arrays. The abstraction
                   is based on Dave Hanson's one-dimensional unboxed array, UArray.

   UArray2.c:      Implementation of the UArray2 interface.
   
   unblackedges.c: The unblackedges program removes black pixels at the edges of
                   scanned pbm images, such as those found in testing/hyphen.pbm

   sudoku.c:       Checks the validity of a 9-by-9 sudoku solution that is provided
                   as a portable gray map (PGM) file.

Correctly implemented:

1. the UArray2 interface and implementation has been built and tested.
1. the Bit2 interface and implementation has been built and tested.
3. sudoku checks whether an input 9x9 sudoku puzzle represented as
   a pgm is correctly solved, successfully returning 0 if it's correct
   and 1 if it's incorrect.
4. unblackedges removes black edge pixels from an input pbm file.

No known problems/limitations!
